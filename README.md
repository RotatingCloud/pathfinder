#pathfinder

Heavily inspired by Cl√©ment Mihailescu's pathfinder tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4t_-NjY_Sg)

Added A* algorithm visualizer

- Changed the start and finish nodes to destination nodes so that users can click anywhere to set up to two points as the ends of the path.
- Changed drawing wall feature to only work when holding shift.
- Created a reset button that clears the board and destination nodes.
